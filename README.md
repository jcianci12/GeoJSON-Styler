Have you ever wanted to style map polygons based on some arbitrary data? eg: population by suburb, and colour and opacity from the count?

This application allows you to choose your geojson polygons (such as suburbs) and some styling data (like text, colour, opacity) and render it on a map.

You can test out this angular application here:

This app is written in angular. Run npm i do install deps and then ng serve to serve the app on port 4200 :)
